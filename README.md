# SoundCortex for LPC
This is an adoption of SoundCortex for LPC810/812.
See [SoundCortex](https://github.com/toyoshim/SoundCortex) for details.
LPC810 version can support I2C and SPI. LPC812 version can support IOEXT protocol for my [CP/Mega32U2](https://github.com/toyoshim/cp-mega88) in addition to I2C and SPI.

## Schematic
[![Schematic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toyoshim/SoundCortexLPC/master/schem.png "Schematic")](https://upverter.com/toyoshim/564092a49959599c/I2CBridge/)

This contains RC LPF that consists from 68Î© register and 0.1uF capasitor. Cut-off frequency of the filter is about 23.4kHz.
You might be able to connect it to mixer without them, but please do it at your own risk. If you ain't lucky enough, your equipments will be damaged.

## How to build
This repository includes prebiult binaries under Release/ directory, but also you can build it by yourself with the LPCXpresso project files included in this repository too.
You need to import CMSIS_CORE_LPX8xx and lpc800_driver_lib from <lpcxpresso>/Examples/Legacy/NXP/LPC800/LPC8xx_Libraries.zip to use these libraries.
For MCUXpresso, you may need CMSIS_DSPLIB_CM0 instead of lpc800_driver_lib. That can be imported from <mcuxpresso>/Examples/CMSIS_DSPLIB/CMSIS_DSPLIB_Latest.zip.

If you are using MCUXpresso, select 'Import...' from the popup menu, and import this project by 'General > Existing Projects into Workspace'. Dependent libraries can be imported as a project archive, via 'Import project(s) from file system...' menu. Library should exist in <mcuxpresso>/ide/Examples/... .

## Pin assign

### LPC810
|pin|  function  | |pin|  function   |
|---|------------|-|---|-------------|
| 1 |SCL (SCK *1)| | 8 |SDA (MOSI *1)|
| 2 |Sound Out   | | 7 |GND          |
| 3 |SWCLK       | | 6 |V3.3         |
| 4 |SWDIO       | | 5 |(SSEL *1)    |

(*1) is description for SPI enabled built

You may need to hold the pin 1 high on PON, since it is originally assigned to /RESET and the reset function is disabled after start up.

### LPC812 (SO20)

(*1) is description for SPI enabled built

You may need to hold the pin 4 high on PON, since it is originally assigned to /RESET and the reset function is disabled after start up.
Note that ISP is disabled by CRP for the IOEXT build.
